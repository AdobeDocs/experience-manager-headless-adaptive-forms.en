# Render your first headless adaptive form

This section describes how to render a sample headless adaptive form. A sample headless adaptive form is included in AEM Archetype. First, you learn how to create and AEM Archetype based project. Then, you use the react app included in the AEM Archetype based project to render the sample form.

Before you start, there are two fundamental concepts that you need to understand and install required software:

* AEM Project Archetype is a Maven template. It creates a minimal project based on best practice to help you get started with Headless Adaptive Forms. Install [Java Development Kit 11](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/general.html?1_group.propertyvalues.property=.%2Fjcr%3Acontent%2Fmetadata%2Fdc%3AsoftwareType&1_group.propertyvalues.operation=equals&1_group.propertyvalues.0_values=software-type%3Atooling&fulltext=Oracle%7E+JDK%7E+11%7E&orderby=%40jcr%3Acontent%2Fjcr%3AlastModified&orderby.sort=desc&layout=list&p.offset=0&p.limit=14) and [Maven 3.6 or later](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) to create AEM Project Archetype based template.

* AEM Project Archetype based project template includes a sample React app. You can use it to render a headless adaptive form. Install [Node.js 16.13.0 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to run the React app.

To render a sample headless adaptive form, follow these steps:

## 1. Create an AEM Archetype based project {#create-an-archetype-based-project}

Depending on the operating system, run the below command to create an Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service project. It is mandatory to create and deploy the [AEM Project Archetype 37](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/overview.html) or later based project during the beta phase. Post-beta the project would be required only for customizations. To create AEM Project Archetype based project template:

**Microsoft Windows**

1. Open the command prompt with Administrative privileges (Run command prompt or bash shell as an administrator).
1. Run the below command:

      ``` shell

        mvn -B org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:3.2.1:generate ^
        -D archetypeGroupId=com.adobe.aem ^
        -D archetypeArtifactId=aem-project-archetype ^
        -D archetypeVersion=37 ^
        -D appTitle=myheadlessform ^
        -D appId=myheadlessform ^
        -D groupId=com.myheadlessform ^
        -D includeFormsenrollment="y" ^
        -D includeFormsheadless="y" 
    
      ```

    * Set `appTitle` to define the title and components groups.
    * Set `appId` to define the Maven artifactId, the component, config and content folder names, and client library names.
    * Set `groupId` to define the Maven groupId and the Java Source Package.
    * Use the `includeFormsenrollment=y` option to include Forms specific configurations, themes, templates, Core Components, and dependencies required to create Adaptive Forms.
    * Use the `includeFormsheadless=y` option to include Forms Core Components and dependencies required to include Headless Adaptive Forms functionality. On enabling this option, the following are included:  
        * The **Blank with core components** template with [core components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/introduction.html?lang=en).
        * A frontend React module, `ui.frontend.react.forms.af`. It helps you render headless adaptive form in a react app.  
        * A sample form at [Archetype Project]\ui.content\src\main\content\jcr_root\content\dam\myheadlessform\af_model_sample.json.

**Apple macOS or Linux**:

1. Open terminal as a root user. It allows you to run commands with administrative privileges. You can also use `sudo root` command after opening the terminal window to run commands with administrative privileges.
1. Run the below command:

      ``` shell

        mvn -B org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:3.2.1:generate \
        -D archetypeGroupId=com.adobe.aem \
        -D archetypeArtifactId=aem-project-archetype \
        -D archetypeVersion=37 \
        -D appTitle=myheadlessform \
        -D appId=myheadlessform \
        -D groupId=com.myheadlessform \
        -D includeFormsenrollment="y" \
        -D includeFormsheadless="y"  

      ```

    * Set `appTitle` to define the title and components groups.
    * Set `appId` to define the Maven artifactId, the component, config, content folder names, and client library names.
    * Set `groupId` to define the Maven groupId and the Java Source Package.
    * Use the `includeFormsenrollment=y` option to include Forms specific configurations, themes, templates, Core Components, and dependencies required to create Adaptive Forms.
    * Use the `includeFormsheadless=y` option to include Forms Core Components and dependencies required to include Headless Adaptive Forms functionality. On enabling this option, the following are included:  
        * The **Blank with core components** template with [core components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/introduction.html?lang=en).
        * A frontend reacts module, `ui.frontend.react.forms.af`. It helps you render headless adaptive form in a react app.
        * A sample form at [Archetype Project]\ui.content\src\main\content\jcr_root\content\dam\myheadlessform\af_model_sample.json.

On successful completion of the command, a project folder with name specified in the `appID` is created. For example, if you use `appID` with value `myheadlessform`, a folder named `myheadlessform` is created. It contains the Archetype based project.
