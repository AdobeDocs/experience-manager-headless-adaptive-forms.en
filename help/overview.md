# Introduction

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Headless Adaptive Forms is a solution for creating and managing headless web forms within the Adobe Experience Manager platform. This feature enables organizations to create, publish, and manage interactive forms that can be accessed and interacted with through APIs, rather than through a traditional graphical user interface. AEM Headless adaptive Forms allow for greater flexibility and scalability in form development and deployment, as well as improved user experience through the ability to tailor form design and functionality to specific needs. By using the capabilities of AEM and headless technology, this solution provides a robust platform for creating, managing, and deploying web forms for various use cases and applications.
