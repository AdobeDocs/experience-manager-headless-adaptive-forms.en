# Getting Started with Headless Adaptive Forms

This tutorial provides you with an end-to-end framework to create a Headless adaptive form. The tutorial is organized into a use case and multiple guides. Each guide helps you learn and add new features to the Headless adaptive form that is created in this tutorial. You have a working Headless adaptive form after every guide. At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to do the following:

* Create a Headless adaptive form
* Add business rules to your form
* Use Google material UI to style form
* Prefill your form
* Embed your form to a webpage

You are also going to build an understanding of the architecture, available artifacts, and JSON structure of Headless adaptive forms.

**The journey starts with learning the use case**:

Raya Tan, a member of the Foreign Department of a country known for its natural beauty and thriving tourism economy, oversees the distribution of visa forms to tourists. These forms are available on the department's website, native mobile apps, and in PDF format, with multiple language options for tourists to choose from. However, managing and scaling these forms across different platforms and technologies can be challenging.

To improve the efficiency and flexibility of their visa application process, the Foreign Department has decided to adopt a Headless adaptive forms approach. This decoupled architecture separates the frontend from the backend, allowing for greater customization and scalability. The department plans to use the React components of Google Material UI to enhance the user experience of the forms. It is also going to use backend capabilities such as the following:

* Digital signatures
* Data integration
* Business process management
* Document of record
* Usage analytics

The most popular form among tourists is the "Contact Us" form, which is used to ask various questions and inquiries. As such, the Foreign Department has chosen to begin implementing the Headless adaptive forms approach with this form. This tutorial guides you through the process of creating the Contact Us form using this new architecture. The final result looks like this:
