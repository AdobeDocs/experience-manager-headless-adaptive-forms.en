**The journey starts with learning the use case**:

Raya Tan, a member of the foreign department of a country known for its natural beauty and thriving tourism economy, oversees the distribution of visa forms to tourists. These forms are available on the department's website, native mobile apps, and in PDF format, with multiple language options for tourists to choose from. However, managing and scaling these forms across different platforms and technologies can be challenging.

In order to improve the efficiency and flexibility of their visa application process, the foreign department has decided to adopt a Headless adaptive forms approach. This decoupled architecture separates the frontend from the backend, allowing for greater customization and scalability. The department plans to use the React components of Google Material UI to enhance the user experience of the forms, while utilizing backend capabilities such as digital signatures, data integration, business process management, document of record, and usage analytics.

The most popular form among tourists is the "Contact Us" form, which is used to ask various questions and inquiries. As such, the foreign department has chosen to begin implementing the Headless adaptive forms approach with this form. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating the Contact Us form using this new architecture. The final result will look like this:
