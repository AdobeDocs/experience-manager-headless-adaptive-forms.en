### Forms Web SDK

Forms Web SDK provides the APIs to validate constraints applied to various fields of a form and hooks to connect JSON structure of form to the UI framework. It also provides React Rendererâ€‹ for Headless adaptive forms to help integrate a Headless adaptive form to your application. The following components of Web SDK are available:

* **[@aemforms/af-react-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aemforms/af-react-components)** 
* **[@aemforms/af-react-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aemforms/af-react-renderer)**

#### Storybook

[Storybook](https://opensource.adobe.com/aem-forms-af-runtime/storybook/) provides an overview of different components of Headless adaptive forms. It also provides a list of all the supported components, their corresponding properties, and constraints.

### Forms Core Component  

<!-- Forms components are the structural elements that constitute the content of the form being authored. These components provide various form fields and ability to customize those fields. -->

Core Components are a set of standardized Web Content Management (WCM) components to help you speed up development time and reduce maintenance cost of your forms. The Forms Container component is a core component. It helps you embed and render a JSON structure of Headless adaptive form in Adaptive Forms editor of Forms as a Cloud Service SDK.  

### Adaptive Forms V2 Specifications

Headless adaptive forms specification provides a detailed information on all the components, constraints, and methods available to define Headless adaptive forms. The specification is available in [PDF](/help/assets/Headless-Adaptive-Form-Specification.pdf) format.

### HTTP and JS API

[HTTP APIs](https://opensource.adobe.com/aem-forms-af-runtime/api/) allow you to list, fetch, validate, submit, track submission status of headless forms. [JS APIs](https://opensource.adobe.com/aem-forms-af-runtime/jsdocs/) helps you use Headless adaptive forms with any JavaScript based UI framework. 

### Visual Studio Code Extension

[Visual Studio Code extension](visual-studio-code-extension-for-headless-adaptive-forms.md) to help create a valid JSON structure. It provides IntelliSense support and validation for JSON structure of forms along with common funcions like add, delete, or rename components of a JSON structure.  

<!-- ## What's next

The following features would be available in upcoming releases:

* HTTP APIs to invoke a business logic.
* Server-side capabilities (Prefill, server-side validation, generating Document of Record (DoR), Submitting to a Form Data Model or using Form Data Models for creating rules, and more).
