## From Contributor To Committer

Adobe is happy for any contribution and reviews your contribution. If you would like to become a committer with full write access and a say in the project, you must be invited to the project. The existing committers employ an internal nomination process that must reach lazy consensus (silence is approval) before invitations are issued. If you believe you are qualified and are interested in becoming more actively involved, reach out to one of the current committers to discuss the next steps.

## Security Issues

Security issues should not be reported on this issue tracker. Instead, [file an issue to Adobe security experts](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/alertus.html)
